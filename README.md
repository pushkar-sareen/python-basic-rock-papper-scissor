# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

This is a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game built in Python. You can play against the computer and see who wins!

# How to Play

Run the Python script.

You'll see a prompt showing the options:

Type:-
0 for Rock,
1 for Paper,
2 for Scissors


Enter your choice by typing 0, 1, or 2.

The computer will randomly choose its move.

The result will be displayed, showing both your choice and the computer's choice.

# Rules

Rock (0) beats Scissors (2)

Paper (1) beats Rock (0)

Scissors (2) beats Paper (1)

If both choices are the same, it’s a Draw.

If an invalid number is entered (anything other than 0, 1, or 2), the game will ask for a valid input.

# Example
Type:-
0 for Rock,
1 for Paper,
2 for Scissors
what do you want to choose ? : 1
you choose Paper
computer choose Rock
You Win!!!
